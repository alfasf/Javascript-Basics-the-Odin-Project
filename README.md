#Project Euler || JavaScript Basics

As part of [**The Odin Project for Javascript**](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-basics?ref=lnav), it was asked to find the solution of sum of the multiples of 3 or 5 from 1 to 1,000.

In this case, I didn't only find the sum of multiples of 3 or 5 but I also created a function that could find the sum of any multiples of numbers given.
